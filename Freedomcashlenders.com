Consumer finance companies offer installment loans in 44 states to borrowers who usually have low credit scores.2 Although allowable finance charges vary significantly across these states,3 prices for these loans are generally higher than banks or credit unions charge customers with higher credit scores. Installment loans range from about $100 to more than $10,000, are repayable in four to 60 monthly installments, and can either be secured—meaning the borrower provides collateral, such as an automobile title or personal property—or unsecured.4 The market is split into lenders who primarily issue small loans, under $1,500, and those that mostly offer large loans.
