To obtain an installment loan, a borrower applies at a local branch or fills out an application on a company website, and then brings proof of identity and residence and recent paystubs to the store to complete the transaction.11 Although the loans are often described as unsecured, most lenders require an auto title and/ or nonessential household goods, such as consumer appliances, electronics, firearms, or jewelry, as collateral, especially for larger loans.

The approval process usually takes 15-60 minutes, during which an employee assesses the applicant’s creditworthiness and underwrites the loan by pulling a credit report and analyzing monthly payments on major credit obligations and some self-reported recurring expenses.13 Loan proceeds are typically disbursed by check or are deposited into the borrower’s checking account, but occasionally proceeds of very small loans are distributed in cash.
