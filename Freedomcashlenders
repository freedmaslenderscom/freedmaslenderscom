Approximately 14,000 consumer finance stores operate nationally, about half of which are owned by the 20 largest national lenders.6 The nationâ€™s largest consumer finance company operates more than 1,800 branches in 44 states.7 These national lenders offer small loans in 18 states,8 while large loans are available across all 44 states that allow installment lending. In general, Southern states tend to allow higher prices and have more stores per capita. (See Figure 1 and Appendix A.) An estimated 10 million people spend more than $10 billion annually for these loans.9 These figures do not include installment loans issued by payday or auto title lenders, which are multipayment loans issued at much higher prices than the traditional installment loans described in this report.
